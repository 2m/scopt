## breaking changes

### two-column rendering

scopt 3.5.0 introduces the notion of rendering mode for the usage text that scopt generates,
and by default it uses two-column rendering that looks like this:

    scopt 3.x
    Usage: scopt [update] [options] [<file>...]

      -f, --foo <value>        foo is an integer property
      -o, --out <file>         out is a required file property

    Command: update [options]
    update is a command.
      --xyz <value>            xyz is a boolean property

Previous (one-column) rendering looked like this:

    scopt 3.x
    Usage: scopt [update] [options] [<file>...]

      -f <value> | --foo <value>
            foo is an integer property
      -o <file> | --out <file>
            out is a required file property

    Command: update [options]
    update is a command.
      --xyz <value>
            xyz is a boolean property

You can switch back to the one-column rendering as follows:

    override def renderingMode = scopt.RenderingMode.OneColumn
